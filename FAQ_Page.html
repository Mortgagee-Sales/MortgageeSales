    <h2>Is there a reserve set at a mortgagee auction?</h2>
    The mortgagee will set a reserve with the auctioneer prior to the auction.
    This reserve is kept confidential between the mortgagee and the auctioneer and is not made public.

    <h2>Can a mortgagee sale property be withdrawn prior to the auction or closing of tenders?</h2>
    The mortgagor has the right to redeem or repay their mortgage, on terms satisfactory to the mortgagee, prior to the property being sold.
    As such, some properties offered for sale on behalf of a mortgagee are withdrawn from sale.
    To find out more about bidding at a mortgagee auction speak to your salesperson.
