    <h1>Who or what is a mortgagee?</h1>

A mortgagee is a party, normally a bank, institution or finance company, sometimes even an individual, who has lent money to another party (the mortgagor) and has taken security for that loan over a property owned by the mortgagor.

<h1>What is a mortgagee sale?</h1>
A mortgagee sale happens when the mortgagor fails to meet their obligations under the mortgage terms; usually by not meeting their mortgage repayments.

The mortgagee then exercises its power of sale and after completing a legal process, the property is sold to recover debt.

In most cases, the property is offered for sale by public auction or tender.

<h1>Mortgagee sales are offered under different terms and conditions</h1>

As the mortgagee is not the owner of the property, it offers the property for sale under different terms and conditions.

For example, most mortgagee sales are not offered for sale with vacant possession and do not include chattels in the sale. Additionally, the mortgagee generally does not give warranties regarding building permits, codes of compliance or boundaries.

<b> </b>

The full sale conditions are contained in the auction particulars and conditions of sale or the tender documents.

Prospective purchasers should obtain a copy of these from the real estate salesperson and familiarise themselves with the conditions of sale before attending the auction or submitting a tender.

If they do not understand any of these conditions or are unsure about any matter, they should consult their solicitor.

It is also the buyer's responsibility to have researched the property fully and satisfied themselves in all respects concerning the property.
